Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - By D J King

This is mainly the same as the first edition although thanks to some suggestions by Keith Stanier
I have replaced many of the larger bitmap pictures for Jpeg versions, this has reduced the size of the download by over half.

The only other difference is that the question answers are now coded so even if you look at the source questions it will not be easily apparent which is the correct answer. Obviously the program de-codes the answers back into A B C or D

This is a British version of Millionaire, apologies to anyone who is not British as you might find some of the questions very tricky.

E.g. Ask the question:  In which English county is Cheddar Gorge A: Dorset / B: Kent / C: Somerset / D: Cornwall - to someone from Britain this is probably an £8,000 question as a good percentage of people will know the answer is C: Somerset, but to an American this is probably a £1,000,000 or should I say $1,000,000 question.

Also any question can be made easy by the alternative answers. E.g.
Who wrote the romantic novel 'Mischief and Marriage' A: Emma Darcy / B: Homer Simpson / C: Mickey Mouse / D: Donald Duck - presented with this question and answers I'd say A: Emma Darcy would be a pretty good guess!

So question? - What makes a good question?

Example: - I like the following question and answers.

Which rock group had a number one hit single in 1986 with 'The Final Countdown'? A: America / B: Europe / C: Asia / D: Africa

All four answers are pop groups, but obviously they are all also names of continents.

Although the above question has been made easier by giving this choice of answers, it's still a good question, but only valued at around £300

That brings me on to valuating questions. A couple of weeks ago a question like : What is the first name of the wife of the Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith? A: Betty / B: Betsy / C: Bobby / D: Beth could easily have been valued at £250,000 as only about 15-20% of people in Britain would know the answer was B: Betsy, but since the recent news articles around 80% of the population of Britain now know the answer.

Anyway I'm going on a bit. - Just hope you enjoy the game...

P.S. I wrote the game in December 2002 and since then I have become a bit of a quiz buff and have been accumulating questions from lots of sources, mainly the Internet. ( at some future date I aim to create a super quiz program with a 10,000 question database )  I currently have approximately 9,000 different questions and answers but I am always looking for new questions, so if anyone has any suggestions for good questions, complete with the 4 answer options please forward them to me at davek606@aol.com.

P.P.S. Any suggestions for future improvements? - I could add more phone a friends and let people choose which phone a friend by displaying them all. I could also include a high score table for recording who reached a million and when.
